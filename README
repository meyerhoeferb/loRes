My own chess game, to then be used to make a chess engine.

I am thinking of the chess logic as the "game" and the search logic
as the "engine", but in reality they are one and the same. The "game" receives
either a move or a board state as input from the CLI (either from human or machine)
and generates possible moves, evaluates the best, updates the state and sends it back.

If playing with a human, this means the CLI should validate the humans move, the
engine assumes the move it is given is valid.
